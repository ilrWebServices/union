    quote: "I came to Cornell knowing I wanted a rigorous program and the ability to learn outside of the classroom. I found the perfect balance at ILR through challenging, interdisciplinary courses and opportunities to study in Dublin, work with the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation in Washington, D.C. and create my own radio show here in Ithaca."

    quote: "Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement. In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is only understood if it's to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of success. Someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords him the time to pursue other interests and activities is considered a flake. A person who abandons a career in order to stay home and raise children is considered not to be living up to his potential-as if a job title and salary are the sole measure of human worth."

Etiam porta sem malesuada magna mollis euismod. Duis mollis, est non commodo luctus, nisi erat porttitor ligula, eget lacinia odio sem nec elit.”
