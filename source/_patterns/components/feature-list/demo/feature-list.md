## Overview

Use feature lists to emphasize the key aspects of a product.

A features list can include:

`title`: Optional, displays as a heading above the list.
`items`: The features to be displayed. Each feature includes a `name`, a `description` and an optional `icon`.
`content_attributes`: Classes that will be added to the grid wrapper. Defaults to `cu-grid--3col`.
