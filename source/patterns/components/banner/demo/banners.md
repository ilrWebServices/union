## Overview

Banners display full-width and are used to highlight and link to important content.


## Description

Banners are different from cards becuase the title overlays the image while the content flows into a second column on wider displays. They will initially be used in combination with the dismissible components, as a way to include an important announcement at the top of a page. Usage may extend over time, though frequent usage should probably be avoided so that they are more visible.
