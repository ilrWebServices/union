## Overview

Dismissibles create a behavior for the content being displayed that allows users to click a close button and hide the content within.


## Description

The dismissible component will initially be used for "pushdown" banner announcements on the homepage. The implementation, however, has been generalized so that any content can be added to a dismissible component, and hidden by the user from the page.

Future enhancements will likely include state management of some sort, so that dismissed content does not reappear for the current user unless the content changes.
