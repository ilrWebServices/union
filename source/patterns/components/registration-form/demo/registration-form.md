## Overview

Registration forms are used display the date, time and cost for events. Multiple events can be added to a form, and the price is dynamically updated via js when a form checkbutton is selected.

## Description

The following variables are available:

`events`: an array of objects that include an `id`, `price` and `content`. The content gets displayed in the label of the checkbutton.

`empty_message`: If the events array is empty, this message will be displayed instead of the form.
